* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): Users can use RDP to connect to a remote PC over a network connection. This requires the user to have appropriate permissions on the remote PC and typically involves providing a username and password.
   - Used by Remote Desktop Services (RDS), 
   - Remote Desktop Web Access (RD Web Access) allows users to access RemoteApp and Desktop Connection through a web browser. Users can launch applications or desktops published on a Remote Desktop Session Host
     (RD Session Host) server without requiring a full RDP connection,
   - Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway), and direct RDP connections.
   - 
* Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker): RD Connection Broker is a role service in Windows Server that enables users to reconnect to their existing sessions in a load-balanced RD Session Host server farm. 
                                                           It helps ensure session persistence and load balancing for remote desktop connections.
* Windows PowerShell Remoting: Relies on WS-Management (WSMan) protocol, which uses SOAP over HTTP/HTTPS, for communication between computers.
* Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): remotely manage Windows computers. This requires appropriate permissions and authentication credentials. Uses DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) for communication between WMI clients and servers.
* Windows Remote Management (WinRM): WinRM uses the WS-Management protocol (WSMan), which uses SOAP over HTTP/HTTPS
* Service Accounts:
* Kerberos Authentication:  Kerberos protocol
* NTLM Authentication:
* SSH (Secure Shell):
* Smart Card Authentication: Utilizes the PKCS#11 protocol
* Certificate-based Authentication: Relies on SSL/TLS for secure communication and certificate-based authentication.
* Web-based Remote Access: uses HTTPS, which is based on SSL/TLS,
* Third-party Remote Access Tools:  TeamViewer, AnyDesk, or LogMeIn. 
* Group Policy Preferences: Administrators can configure Group Policy Preferences to automatically map network drives, printers, and other resources for users based on their group membership or other criteria when they log in to a domain-joined PC.
                            Relies on SMB (Server Message Block) protocol for accessing and configuring resources on remote computers.
* Cached Credentials: Typically relies on the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) for authentication and access to cached credentials stored locally on the computer.
* Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway): RD Gateway is a role service in Windows Server that enables authorized remote users to connect to resources on an internal corporate or private network over the internet, using RDP.
* Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Join: Utilizes modern authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization.
* Remote Desktop Web Access (RD Web Access): allows users to access RemoteApp and Desktop Connection through a web browser. Users can launch applications or desktops published on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) 
                                             server without requiring a full RDP connection.


DAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): LDAP is used for querying and modifying directory services, such as AD, which stores usr acc information in a domain environment. While not typically used directly for user login, LDAP is fundamental
                                             for authentication and authorization processes in Windows domains.

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): SAML is an XML-based protocol used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers and service providers. In some scenarios, particularly with 
federated identity solutions, SAML can be used for single sign-on (SSO) to authenticate users across different domains or applications.

OAuth (Open Authorization): OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used in conjunction with modern web and mobile applications. It allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources 
without sharing their credentials directly. While not a login protocol in the traditional sense, OAuth facilitates secure access to resources across domains.

OpenID Connect: OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, providing an authentication layer that enables clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an
authorization server. It is commonly used for single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity scenarios.

Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD): KCD is a feature of the Kerberos authentication protocol that allows a service to impersonate a client and access resources on behalf of that client.
It is commonly used in multi-tier applications where a front-end service needs to access back-end resources on behalf of the user.

OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout: This protocol allows applications to request that a user be logged out of all relying parties after logging out of one application.
It enhances security by ensuring that users are fully logged out across all applications in a federated identity scenario.

WS-Federation (Web Services Federation): WS-Federation is a protocol extension to WS-Trust and is often used for federated identity scenarios. 
3It enables cross-domain authentication and single sign-on between different security domains.
