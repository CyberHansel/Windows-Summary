* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

* Windows PowerShell Remoting: Relies on WS-Management (WSMan) protocol, which uses SOAP over HTTP/HTTPS, for communication between computers.
PSRemoting:
- Enter-PSSession, Invoke-Command, and New-PSSession    ; (leverages the WinRM protocol for communication between the local and remote machines) 
- New-ADUser, Get-ADComputer, and Set-ADUser            ; The Active Directory module (part of the Remote Server Administration Tools) 

* Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): 

remotely manage Windows computers. This requires appropriate permissions and authentication credentials. Uses DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) for communication between WMI clients and servers.
* Windows Remote Management (WinRM): WinRM uses the WS-Management protocol (WSMan), which uses SOAP over HTTP/HTTPS
* Service Accounts:
* Kerberos Authentication:  Kerberos protocol
* NTLM Authentication:
* SSH (Secure Shell):
* Smart Card Authentication: Utilizes the PKCS#11 protocol
* Certificate-based Authentication: Relies on SSL/TLS for secure communication and certificate-based authentication.
* Web-based Remote Access: uses HTTPS, which is based on SSL/TLS,
* Third-party Remote Access Tools:  TeamViewer, AnyDesk, or LogMeIn. 
* Group Policy Preferences: Administrators can configure Group Policy Preferences to automatically map network drives, printers, and other resources for users based on their group membership or other criteria when they log in to a domain-joined PC.
                            Relies on SMB (Server Message Block) protocol for accessing and configuring resources on remote computers.
* Cached Credentials: Typically relies on the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) for authentication and access to cached credentials stored locally on the computer.
* Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway): RD Gateway is a role service in Windows Server that enables authorized remote users to connect to resources on an internal corporate or private network over the internet, using RDP.
* Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Join: Utilizes modern authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization.
* Remote Desktop Web Access (RD Web Access): allows users to access RemoteApp and Desktop Connection through a web browser. Users can launch applications or desktops published on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) 
                                             server without requiring a full RDP connection.



Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC): 
LDAP used for querying and modifying directory services, such as AD, which stores usr acc information in a domain environment. While not typically used directly for user login, LDAP is fundamental for authentication and authorization processes in Windows domains.

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): SAML is an XML-based protocol used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers and service providers. In some scenarios, particularly with 
federated identity solutions, SAML can be used for single sign-on (SSO) to authenticate users across different domains or applications.

OAuth (Open Authorization): OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used in conjunction with modern web and mobile applications. It allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources 
without sharing their credentials directly. While not a login protocol in the traditional sense, OAuth facilitates secure access to resources across domains.

OpenID Connect: OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, providing an authentication layer that enables clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an
authorization server. It is commonly used for single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity scenarios.

Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD): KCD is a feature of the Kerberos authentication protocol that allows a service to impersonate a client and access resources on behalf of that client.
It is commonly used in multi-tier applications where a front-end service needs to access back-end resources on behalf of the user.

OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout: This protocol allows applications to request that a user be logged out of all relying parties after logging out of one application.
It enhances security by ensuring that users are fully logged out across all applications in a federated identity scenario.

WS-Federation (Web Services Federation): WS-Federation is a protocol extension to WS-Trust and is often used for federated identity scenarios. 
3It enables cross-domain authentication and single sign-on between different security domains.



Active Directory module Get-ADUser, Get-ADComputer, Get-ADGroup, New-ADUser, Set-ADUser, etc., use the LDAP protocol to communicate with domain controllers and query or modify Active Directory objects.

WMI deprecated
* The PowerShell Management Libraries
- Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure (MI) (WSMan) (Windows Remote Management) protocol, which provides better security features, such as encryption, authentication, and message integrity. WSMan is designed with security in mind and is considered more secure than DCOM/RPC (WMI uses this) for remote management tasks. is cross-platform management library that provides a standardized API for managing resources in Windows and non-Windows environments. Designed to replace the older WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) infrastructure and offers improved performance, scalability, and compatibility. 
- System.Management.Automation (SMA),  primarily used for creating programs or applications that leverage PowerShell scripting capabilities. 
OR
More secure alternative to WMI is CIM (Common Information Model) CimCmdlets module. CIM operates over the WSMan (Windows Remote Management) protocol, which provides secure and standardized communication channels for remote management tasks.
CIM operates over standard HTTP(S) ports (typically 5985 for HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS), compared to the dynamic RPC ports used by WMI.



#######

    PSRemoting:
        PowerShell Remoting uses the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) protocol, which is Microsoft's implementation of the WS-Management (WSMan) protocol. WinRM operates over HTTP or HTTPS and relies on standards-based protocols for secure communication between the local and remote machines.

    Active Directory Module:
        The Active Directory module typically communicates with remote domain controllers using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for querying and modifying Active Directory objects and services. Additionally, RPC (Remote Procedure Call) may be used for certain operations that require direct communication with domain controllers.



PSDscResources (Desired State Configuration) (uses WinRM): PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) allows you to configure and manage the state of remote computers in a declarative manner. It includes a set of built-in DSC resources (PSDscResources module) for managing various aspects of Windows configuration, such as services, registry settings, and user accounts, on remote machines.  DSC uses WinRM

---------------------------------

PowerShell Empire:

    PowerShell Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes modules and scripts for performing various offensive security tasks, including remote exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence on compromised systems. While primarily used for security testing and red teaming, it demonstrates the potential for leveraging PowerShell for remote access and control.


    PSDscResources (Desired State Configuration):
        Desired State Configuration (DSC) can use either the Common Information Model (CIM) protocol or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) protocol for communication with managed nodes. CIM operates over WSMan, similar to WinRM, while WMI uses DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) for communication.

    PowerShell Management Libraries:
        The PowerShell Management Libraries, such as Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure (MI) and System.Management.Automation (SMA), provide APIs and cmdlets for interacting with remote systems using protocols like WSMan for CIM operations or DCOM for WMI operations.

    PowerShell Empire:
        PowerShell Empire modules typically leverage a combination of PowerShell Remoting (WinRM), SMB (Server Message Block), and other Windows networking protocols for remote exploitation, lateral movement, and communication with compromised systems.
